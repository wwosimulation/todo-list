## Developer Process

On the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/wwosimulation/projects/2) for Narrator Bot, there are different columns:
- To Do: Hackante
- To Do: Assistants
- In Progress
- Not Assigned
- Unapproved Suggestions
- Unverified Bugs
- Complete
- On Hold

When you go to start work on Narrator Bot, this is the priority order:
1) In Progress cards that are assigned to you
2) To Do cards for Assistants
3) Not Assigned cards
4) Verify bugs from the Unverified Bugs column
